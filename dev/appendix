Camera:
	- Objects currently within the camera's rect are rendered to the screen. 
	- If Scene's playable area is smaller than the Camera's rect, the Scene is
	  centered in the window.
	- The Camera moves with the player until the player is within rect.w / 2 of a
	  Scene boundary, at which point the Camera stops moving.
	- By default, the Camera's width and height are equal to those of the window.

FrameTimer:
	- Calculates the average FPS using the last 100 frames.
	- RenderSystem calls FrameTimer.tick() to record next frame time.

Main:
	- Loads the user config, scene, and starts game loop. Handles input and 
	  calls Physics.tick() and RenderSystem.render().

PhysicsSystem:
	- Handles collisions and player kinematics with a Scene and set of input.

RenderSystem:
	- Renders the intersection of a Camera and a Scene to the window.

Scene:
	- Stores all the player, enemy, and environment data.

Types:
	- Contains useful typedefs (e.g. unsigned int -> uint32_t)
