Remove stuttering by enabling double-buffering?

In each level config, specify the artBlock height and min/max values for scaling
to worldBlock heights. Ideally, the level should fit entirely within the window.
Is this really important though? Just set the artBlock height to 16, plan for the
entire level to fit in a height of 720 (so if pixels are 32 high, can fit 22.5
blocks. Or shrink the window?
